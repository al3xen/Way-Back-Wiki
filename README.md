**Way Back Wiki**

  

[Way Back Wiki](https://www.waybackwiki.org) is an open-source project that enables users to explore the history of Wikipedia articles. It offers a simple interface to view article revisions, visualize changes over time, and compare different versions of articles. This project is beginner-friendly, making it an excellent starting point for new developers who want to contribute to an open-source project.

  

**Features**

  

•  **Search Wikipedia articles**: Easily find any Wikipedia article by searching for it directly.

•  **View article revisions**: A heatmap visualization shows when and how frequently an article has been revised.

•  **Compare article versions**: Highlight differences between two versions of an article.

•  **Responsive design**: The site works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

  

**Tech Stack**

  

Way Back Wiki uses modern web technologies to deliver a fast and responsive experience. Here’s what you’ll be working with:

  

•  [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications.

•  [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.

•  [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for styling the interface.

•  [**Shadcn UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/): For customizable UI components.

•  [**React Calendar Heatmap**](https://github.com/kevinsqi/react-calendar-heatmap): A React component for visualizing time-series data in a calendar heatmap format.

2. **Install dependencies**: We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

  
```
pnpm install
```
  

  

3. **Run the development server**:

  
```
pnpm run dev
```

**Development Tips**

  

•  **Next.js**: This project uses Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation. You can learn more about Next.js [here](https://nextjs.org/docs).

•  **TypeScript**: We’re using TypeScript to make the code more predictable and easier to debug. If you’re unfamiliar with TypeScript, check out the [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

•  **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind is a powerful CSS utility framework. If you’re new to it, you can refer to their [getting started guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
